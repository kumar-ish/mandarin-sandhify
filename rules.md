## Introduction

This document lays out some of the tone sandhi rules in Mandarin (though some are missing).

## Rules

“不 bù changes to bú when it occurs before another fourth-toned syllable in the same word, phrase, or breath group:”

“2.3.2 Tone change in the numbers — yī ‘1,’ 七 qī ‘7,’ and 八 bā ‘8’
The tone of the numbers — yī ‘1,’ and, less commonly, 七 qī ‘7,’ and 八 bā ‘8’ may change to second tone yí, qí, and bá before a fourth-toned syllable in the same word, phrase, or breath group:”

“In addition, — yī changes to fourth tone before syllables with first, second, or third tone”

---

When two consecutive third tones appear in a group, the first third tone changes to a second tone.

If several third tones appear in a row, only the last one in the group is actually pronounced as a third tone. The others change to second tones. For example, the name of the popular Chinese cold medicine 999 contains a series of three third tones (九九九 jiǔjiǔjiǔ). When pronounced, though, the first two third tones will change to second tones so that the name actually becomes “jiújiújiǔ.”
